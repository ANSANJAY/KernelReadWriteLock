### 1. Explain the Technical Concept 📘

- **Code Snippet**: 
  ```c
  read_lock(&mylock);
  write_lock(&mylock);
  ```
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - Executing these two function calls in sequence within the same thread will indeed cause a deadlock. 

- **Why?**
  - `read_lock(&mylock)`: This function will lock `mylock` for reading.
    - **Multiple threads** can hold a **read lock** at the same time, preventing any write locks.
    
  - `write_lock(&mylock)`: This function attempts to lock `mylock` for writing. This will only succeed when there are no active read or write locks, which is an issue in this snippet because a read lock is already held.

- **Deadlock**:
  - The second function (`write_lock(&mylock)`) will spin indefinitely because it's waiting for all readers (including the current thread, due to the previous `read_lock` call) to release the lock, which will never happen in this sequence.

### 2. Curious Questions 🧐💬

- **Question 1**: What is a deadlock, and why is it problematic in concurrent programming?
  - **Answer**: A deadlock is a state in concurrent execution where two or more threads are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a lock. It's problematic because it results in threads being stuck indefinitely, consuming resources, and potentially halting program execution.

- **Question 2**: How might you resolve a deadlock like the one in the provided code snippet?
  - **Answer**: Ensuring that locks are always acquired and released in a well-defined order and utilizing lock hierarchy, timeouts, or trying alternative paths when waiting for locks can mitigate and resolve deadlocks. In the context of the provided snippet, reorganizing code logic to avoid nested or sequential different type locks on the same object could prevent the deadlock.

- **Question 3**: Can a deadlock occur with a single lock and a single thread?
  - **Answer**: Yes, a deadlock can occur even with a single lock and a single thread if the thread attempts to acquire a lock it already holds (reentrant locking), and the lock type doesn’t support reentrancy (like the non-recursive mutexes).

### 3. Simple Words Explanation 🍦🗣️

- **Imagine** a scenario where you go to an ice-cream shop 🍦. You ask the vendor for a scoop of chocolate ice cream and he starts scooping it for you. While he's scooping, you suddenly say, "Wait! Add a cherry on top before you give me that scoop!" 🍒. 

- The vendor says, "Sure, but I can only add the cherry after I've scooped the ice cream into your cone 🍦➡️🍒."

- Now, you insist on having the cherry first and he insists on giving you the scoop first. Both of you are stuck. You're waiting for him to put a cherry on nothing, and he's waiting for you to take the scoop so he can add the cherry. No one moves forward. That's a **deadlock**! 🔄🔒

- In the code world, a similar thing is happening: one part of the code is waiting to read 📖 because it’s currently writing ✍️, but it can’t finish writing because it’s waiting for itself to finish reading - it's stuck waiting for something that will never happen. 🔄🚫 So, it’s always wise to organize our code to avoid these scenarios, ensuring we don't end up stuck in the ice cream shop of deadlock! 🍦🚫🔄
